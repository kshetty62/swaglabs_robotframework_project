Features
UI Testing: Automates user interactions using Selenium.
API Testing: Validates REST APIs with the Requests library.
Modular Design: Keywords, variables, and locators are reusable and centralized.
Parallel Execution: Supports parallel test execution using Pabot.
Environment-Specific Testing: Configurations for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
Data-Driven Testing: Enables dynamic test execution with different inputs.


Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
